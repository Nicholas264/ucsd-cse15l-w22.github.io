## Lecture Materials & Quiz



## Lab Tasks

In this lab you'll set your computer up for remote access to the CSE lab
computers and practice with commands that work with the filesystem.

### Part 1 – Meet Your Group!

We've organized everyone into groups of 6-7 students for discussion. These
groups will be somewhat stable throughout the quarter, though some small changes
might happen. You will have a tutor or TA assigned to your group for help and
discussion.

We ask that you turn your camera on when in your small groups unless you are
unable to for some reason.

Your discussion leader will share a Google Doc with your group where you can
fill in notes as you work; this document is only for your group. Your discussion
leader will _not_ take notes for you, you can have someone volunteer to take
notes or come up with a way to share the role.

In your groups, share, and note in the running notes document (discussion
leaders, you answer these as well!):

- How you'd like people to refer to you (pronounce your name/nickname, pronouns
like he/her/they, etc)
- Your major
- **One** of:
    - A UCSD student organization you're a member of or interested in
    - What UCSD college you're in
    - Where you're calling in from

### Part 2 – Visual Studio Code

**In Your Group for 10 minutes**

Go to the Visual Studio Code website
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the
instructions to download and install it on your computer. There are versions for
all the major operating systems, like OSX (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs). If
you only have access to a tablet or Chromebook while remote, you won't be able
to install it right now.  If you don't, you should chat your lab leader and let
them know, and for any pair activities this week and next we will make sure to
pair you with someone who does.

If you run into an error installing Visual Studio Code, speak up! You can
screenshare and ask for help, and the tutor or someone in your group might be
able to answer for you!

When it is installed, you should be able to open a window that looks like this
(it might have different colors, or a different menu bar, depending on your
system and settings):

### Part 3 – Remotely Connecting

**In Your Group for 15 minutes**

Many courses in CSE use course-specific accounts. These are similar to accounts
you might get on other systems at other institutions (or a future job). We'll
see how to use VScode to connect to a remote computer over the Internet to do
work there.

There is a first step you need if you're on Windows: install a program called
OpenSSH, which is a program that can connect your computer to other computers
that have this kind of account:

[Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

Then, look up your course-specific account for CSE15L here:

[https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Then, in Visual Studio Code, we are going to connect to the remote computer
using VSCode's remote option.  For reference, we're following the steps in
[“Connect to a remote
host”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host)
step.

For the first step, open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl or Command + ```, or use the
Terminal → New Terminal menu option).  Your command will look like this, but
with the `ZZ` replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.

```
ssh cs15lZZ@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

You should be prompted with your password, and maybe a (yes/no) option for
connecting for the first time (you can choose yes).

Once logged in, you should see something like this:

FILL

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any
commands you run will run on that computer! We call your computer the _client_
and the computer in the basement the _server_ based on how you are connected.

You can run the command `hostname` to see some information about that computer.
It should look something like this:

```
hostname
FILL
```

Stop and tell your group when you get to this point (running `uname -a` on the
remote computer).

If, in this process, you run into errors and can't figure out how to proceed,
ask! When you ask take a screenshot of your problem and add it to your group's
running notes document, then describe what the fix was.

Remember – it is **rare** for a tutorial to work perfectly. We often have to
stop, think, guess, Google search, ask someone, etc. in order to get things to
work the way the tutorial says. So you are helping your group _learn about
potential issues_ when you do this, and that's a major learning outcome of the
course! If you see someone else have an issue that you didn't, ask why, and what
might be different about what you did, or how your environment is set up. You
will learn by reflecting on this.

When you're done, **discuss** what you saw. Take a screenshot or copy/paste the
output of the `hostname` command into the shared notes doc. Did you all see the
same thing? What might the differences mean? Note the results of your discussion
in the notes document.

### Part 4 – Connecting VSCode

So far, you've gotten a terminal open that's connected to the remote server. You
could run some commands there.  A common task we want to perform is programming
on a remote server, by opening and editing files that are on that computer, and
running them there (like with the `javac` and `java` commands).

VSCode, and many other editors, have the ability to connect to a server and open
files from there, rather than just opening files on your computer. This is a
useful, general practice in development. Sometimes a remote computer has special
software installed, or is much faster or more powerful, or has permissions to
access certain data that should not leave a particular location. In all of these
cases, we need some way to do the usual tasks of programming—editing and running
commands—on the files on that remote server.

Follow the instructions in [Connect to a Remote
Host](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host)
in order to connect VSCode (not just the terminal) to the server.

You can now use `File -> Open` to open and create a folder on the server!
